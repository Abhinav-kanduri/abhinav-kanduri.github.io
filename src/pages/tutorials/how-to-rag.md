# How to Build a RAG System

## Description & Problem Statement

**Description**  
This guide walks you through building a production‑grade Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain. You’ll learn how to ingest and preprocess documents, generate and index embeddings in a vector store, implement a retriever that fetches the most relevant context, and orchestrate an LLM to produce grounded, accurate answers. The result is a scalable API service that serves real‑time, context‑aware responses—mitigating hallucinations and knowledge cutoff issues inherent to standalone LLM deployments.

**Problem Statement**  
Large language models often generate plausible but unverified or outdated information because they lack direct access to up‑to‑date, domain‑specific knowledge. Manual document search is slow and error‑prone, and simple keyword matching fails to capture semantic relevance at scale. Organizations need an automated pipeline that—at low latency—retrieves precisely the right snippets from a growing corpus of documents and uses those to ground LLM responses. This project addresses that need by combining vector‑based retrieval with state‑of‑the‑art LLMs, ensuring both accuracy and performance under production workloads.
